# ESPGadgetV2
From ESP32 Unleashed course by Tech Explorations

This is my version of the code after taking the course.

It includes a ESP32, Touch TFT display with SD card, BME280 sensor. 

I'm adding a RTC DS3231. Will use NTP time to set the clock.

MQTT to AdaFruitIO temp/humid, will also log to SD card.
